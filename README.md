## Project description

This is an API designed to manage a shop inventory. It allows users to register with different roles (Admin, Manager, Employee, Basic User) and uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.

A basic user interface was developed to facilitate the API test using templating engine.
    
Depending on the role, you can:
   1. Administrator (Admin):

Has full acces to all functionality. Can create, update and delete products, categories and suppliers.
Manages users, assigns roles and has control over all data in the system.

   2. Manager:

Has access to all inventory operations, but cannot manage users or modify roles.
Can view, add, edit, and delete products and manage inventory. 

   1. Employee:

Can view and update inventory.
Can add new products, but cannot delete them.
Has no access to user management or system settings.

   4. Basic User (like a client):

Has only permissions to view products in inventory.
Cannot add, edit, or delete any records.

## Used technologies
**Node.js:**  as the runtime environment for building the server-side application.

**Express JS:** to create the RESTful API, providing a robust set of features for routing and middleware handling.

**MySQL:** as the database engine for storing and managing the inventory data.

**Sequelize:** was the chosen ORM to facilitate de database management, allowing easy interaction with MySQL using JavaScript.

**JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** used for authentication, enabling secure token-based user sessions across the application.

**PUG:** the templating engine used for developing user interface.
